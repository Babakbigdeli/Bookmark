# Bookmark
An online application to help you keep track of your reading

# With this application we wanted to create an app for book lovers to use to track there reading.

A reader can visit the app & sign up to become a member of a personal book tracking account.

Then they can search for new books & add them to a category.

1) they can add books to history that they have already read.
2) they can add books to currently reading
3) they can add books to the want to read when they have finished their current book.

this will enable them to have a personal list of their own library of books.

# Members of Bookmark can do the following as well

1) use the news feed to look for new books coming on the market or currently on the market that they can then look for using the search bar.

2) we will have a reading progress bar to keep track of pages with a click add button to the bar, so they know the page they have got to.
